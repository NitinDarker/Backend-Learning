# Backend-Learning

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey into Backend Web Development – a mix of learning, experimenting, and yes, making a lot of rookie mistakes. It’s not perfect, but it’s real, and it shows how I’ve grown over time.

## What’s Inside
- **Learning Milestones**: A collection of the projects and snippets I’ve worked on as I’ve tackled new backend concepts.
- **Cohort Assignments**:  Assignments from Cohort 2.0 & 3.0, by Harkirat Singh, whose mentorship I am deeply grateful for. These assignments were challenging but transformative, pushing me to grow and excel in ways I hadn’t imagined.
- **Experiments and Examples**: All the little bits of code I’ve written while figuring things out. These might not always be polished, but they helped me learn.

## Why This Exists
I started this repository to track my progress and have something to look back on, but over time it’s become more than that. It’s a place where I can:
- **Reflect** on the things I’ve learned and the mistakes I’ve made.
- **Share** my journey with others who might just be starting out and show them it’s okay to stumble.
- **Keep learning** by revisiting old projects and improving them.

## Tech I’ve Played With
- **JavaScript**: As a Medium to write code
- **Node.js**: For building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: To make server logic and API routing simpler.
- **MongoDB**: Learning how to handle databases and use Mongoose.
- **REST APIs**: Designing and implementing endpoints for various use cases.
- **....** and many more

## How to Use This Repo
Browse around, check out the code, and maybe even try running some of it. It’s not perfect, but it’s here to show how much I’ve learned (and still have to learn). If you have suggestions or want to share your thoughts, feel free to reach out – I’m always open to feedback!

**Thanks for making it this far!**

**YOU ARE THE BEST**
